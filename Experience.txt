Hello, I am Swagatam. Currently I am a fresher at IIT Patna pusuing my B.Tech degree in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science. My one and a half months of experience at IIT Patna has been okay. It was not what I thought it would be. Especially the class schedule and lab hours feel hectic. But Saturdays and Sundays are a relief. Sadly they keep classes on some Saturdays as well. The club events conducted here are great. Also there was a fresher's "fest" orgnaised called "Nebula". To be honest, Nebula was not really a great or mesmerising experience, certainly a lot below my expectations. So that's it. That's all I had to say (or write). Bye.
